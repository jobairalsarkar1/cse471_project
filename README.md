## University Student's Management System.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
    UniHelper is a university management web application which I built as a personal project to improve on an existing university site. Inspired by the need for better functionality, UniHelper provides a dynamic experience tailored for different user (Admins, Students, and Teachers) with different, role-specific capabilities.

## Getting Started

Just in case you want to set up and run UniHelper locally follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have these installed:

- <span style="color:#339933;">Node.js</span>
- <span style="color:#F8E71C;">MongoDB</span>

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jobairalsarkar1/UniHelper.git
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables**:

    To run the UniHelper project, you need to set up several environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of your backend directory and add the following variables:

    ```bash
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI='your_mongodb_connection_string'  # Replace with your MongoDB connection string
    JWT_SECRET='your_jwt_secret'                  # Replace with your JWT secret

    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME='your_cloudinary_cloud_name'   # Replace with your Cloudinary cloud name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY='your_cloudinary_api_key'         # Replace with your Cloudinary API key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET='your_cloudinary_api_secret'   # Replace with your Cloudinary API secret

    GOOGLE_API_TOKEN='your_google_api_token'              # Replace with your Google API token

    EMAIL='your_email@example.com'                        # Replace with your email address

    CLIENT_ID='your_google_client_id'                     # Replace with your Google Client ID
    CLIENT_SECRET='your_google_client_secret'             # Replace with your Google Client Secret
    REFRESH_TOKEN='your_google_refresh_token'             # Replace with your Google Refresh

    ```

3.  **Save the `.env` file** and ensure it is not tracked by Git by adding it to your `.gitignore` file. If you are using a Unix-based system (like macOS or Linux), you can use:

    ```bash
    echo ".env" >> .gitignore
    ```

    For Windows users, you can manually add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file using a text editor.

4.  **Run the application**:
    After setting up the environment variables, you can run the servers:

    - **Backend**:
      Navigate to the backend directory and run:

      ```bash
      cd backend
      npm start
      ```

    - **Frontend**:
      Navigate to the frontend directory and run:
      ```bash
      cd ../frontend
      npm run dev
      ```

## 🚨 Important

After cloning the repository, you'll need to update the API URLs and replace with your local address:

```javascript
//Example
const res = await axios.get(
  "http://localhost:5000/api/users/profile", // Change this URL if needed
);
//Replace the
"http://localhost:5000" with "http://localhost:5000"
```
